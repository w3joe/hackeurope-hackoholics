Analyse inventory gaps for each pharmacy given the inventory dataset and risk context.

## Inventory Dataset
{{ inventory_json }}

## Risk Context (from upstream risk assessments)
{{ risk_context_json }}

Produce gap_reports for each pharmacy. Each report must include: pharmacy_id, pharmacy_name, location, critical_gaps (array), total_estimated_restock_cost_usd, overall_readiness_score (0-1), summary.
Each critical_gap: drug_name, category, issue (UNDERSTOCKED|MISSING|NEAR_EXPIRY), current_quantity, recommended_quantity, urgency, estimated_restock_cost_usd, preferred_supplier_id, preferred_supplier_name, supplier_lead_time_days.
