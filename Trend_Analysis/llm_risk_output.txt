C2. TDA Entropy Trend: Forward Signal
TDA does not forecast directly. Read the recent entropy trajectory
to assess whether the system is moving toward or away from anomaly.

Historical avg lead time (from elevation >1.5σ to confirmed anomaly): ~7 weeks

STATUS: Entropy within normal range.
H0_z=+0.65  H1_z=-0.36
No imminent topological risk signal from TDA at this time.

C3. Convergence Flags — Weeks Where Both Methods Agree
Highest-confidence risk: Holt-Winters forecasts HIGH RISK AND TDA signals anomaly/elevation.

No full convergence found in forecast window.
This means HW and TDA risk windows do not overlap in the next 12 weeks.
